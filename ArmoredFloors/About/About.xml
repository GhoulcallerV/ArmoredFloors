    <description>Armor plating for your floors to keep those beastly burrowing bugs out of your base. Tiles with overhead mountain can have armored floors installed to make them safe again. 
Note that the flooring only prevents the _event_ from spawning at a given position. Bug nests can still appear on armored tiles if an infestation spawns on an unarmored tile (the infestation event occurs at one point then spawns nests all around).</description>
